# COMP615-Advanced-Topics-in-Computation-Theory-
Fall 2021 - Professor: John Noga


## Course Objectives: 
To understand some of the fundamental, theoretical limitations on computation. The course
will contain:
- an abbreviated review of material on regular and context free languages covered in a typical undergraduate
automata theory course (basics of DFAs, NFAs, regular expressions, regular grammars, CFGs, NPDAs, pumping
lemmas, closure properties),
- selected topics on regular and context free languages which are usually skimmed or omitted for time reasons
from undergraduate courses (eg Myhill-Nerode Theorem, Ogden’s Lemma, equivalence of CFGs and NPDAs),
- selected topics related to regular and context free languages not typically included in undergraduate courses (eg
Mealy/Moore machines, 2-way automata, Parikh’s Theorem, DPDAs, linear languages, LL grammars, context
sensitive languages),
- Turing Machines, recursive and recursively enumerable languages, undecidability, unrestricted grammars, and
related topics.
